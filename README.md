### AppStore

The `AppStore` acts as a central hub for managing the application-level state and logic. It encapsulates the business logic of the application, interfacing between the UI and the backend services or APIs. This store is responsible for handling actions, managing domain-specific entities, and providing methods for modifying the application state that reflects user interactions or data changes. It might include operations like authentication, managing user sessions, handling complex user interactions that affect multiple parts of the application, and aggregating data needed for the application's views.

For instance, in a blogging platform, the `AppStore` might manage entities like articles, comments, and user profiles, providing methods to fetch, add, update, and delete these entities. It would interact with the `ApiStore` to perform these operations against a backend service.

### ApiStore

The `ApiStore` is specifically focused on interactions with external APIs or backend services. It abstracts away the details of API calls, providing a clean and simplified API for the rest of the application to use when accessing external data. This store handles making HTTP requests, managing API endpoints, and processing responses. It's responsible for error handling, transforming data, and potentially caching responses to improve performance and reduce network traffic.

In the context of the same blogging platform, the `ApiStore` would contain methods for all the HTTP requests related to articles, comments, and user profiles, such as fetching a list of articles, submitting a new comment, or updating a user profile. It acts as a data layer that the `AppStore` relies on to perform data-related operations.

### PageStore

`PageStore` is tailored for managing state and logic that are specific to individual pages or components of the application. It is more granular and focused compared to the `AppStore`, dealing with the UI state that doesn't need to be shared across the application. This could include form states, local UI preferences, page-specific data fetching, and temporary UI states like loaders, modals, and notifications.

Each page or a complex component might have its associated `PageStore`, allowing for a modular and organized state management approach. These stores can still interact with the `AppStore` for application-wide state or actions and use the `ApiStore` for data fetching or submitting.

For the blogging platform, a `ProfilePageStore` might manage the state of the profile editing form, including form validation, showing or hiding sections of the form, and temporarily displaying success or error messages after an update operation. It would use the `AppStore` or `ApiStore` to fetch the initial profile data and submit the changes.

---

In summary, `AppStore`, `ApiStore`, and `PageStore` together form a comprehensive state management architecture that separates concerns, simplifies data handling, and enhances the modularity and scalability of a React application. Each store has a distinct responsibility, working in concert to support complex user interactions, manage data effectively, and keep the UI in sync with the application state.
